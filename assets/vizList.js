/*
here we have some essential data for the dashboard, kept seperate from the code. 
this makes both easier to read and maintain.
this was initially created by by converting the google sheet for the project
tech debt/notes:
    * visualization_description is copied from the sheet but not used in the app
    * given the length of the tooltip content, it might make sense to split some of the content out into
      seperate similar files
    * for 'info', the backticks are important. be sure to paste your html inside the backticks
    * make sure each item in the list is seperated by a comma
    * make sure each object is enclosed in brackets and each object is comma seperated
    * ask a dev or a tech savvy person if you're having trouble! <3
    * link: this was the original link to the viz on tableau if it was't being embedded somewhere
    * url: this is the link we actually need to embed a viz on our page

        Children represent a smaller percentage of those sheltered than newly homeless. This is likely due to the fact that children, especially unaccompanied children enter into other systems like the child protective services, foster care, or into the care of family.

      <ul>
      <li>Rapid Rehousing (RRH) - Rental assistance for periods of time up to 24 months. The goals of this program is to help people get housed quickly and without preconditions (such as income, absence of a criminal record, or sobriety).
      <li>Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) -Long-term housing and supportive services for families and people with disabilities.
      <li>Other Permanent Housing (OPH) - A federally funded program that provides long-term housing, without supportive services.

      <p>
        Sometimes the number of people who exit to housing is higher than the number of people who stayed in a shelter. An example of this is the veteran population. A higher exit number means that a portion of the exits to housing are happening from the street. A shelter stay is not required to qualify for housing assistance. Veterans have received focused attention and funding from multiple agencies since 2016, which accounts for the high housing rate amongst this demographic.

      <p>
        Not returning to homelessness services in Austin’s Continuum of Care does not necessarily indicate that an individual is no longer experiencing homelessness. These individuals may be seeking services in a different area or avoiding services altogether.

        <strong>Comparing Austin to other major Continuums of Care.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        2019 data shows that 17% of individuals that received homelessness services in Austin returned to homelessness within 2 years. The national median for major cities is 18%.

        <strong>Three barrier types that contribute to homelessness:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Structural<br><br></strong>Lack of affordable housing, and lack of support for those struggling with disability, employment, mental health, substance abuse, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Institutional</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Government institutions often discharge people without helping them secure stable housing, including<strong> </strong>the foster care system, military, hospitals, prisons, and other justice facilities.

      <p>
        <strong>Relationship</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The loss of a close relationship impacts mental health. A person who depended on a street community for emotional and physical safety, may have difficulty transitioning to housing.
